**Part One 
The following ODE can be solved easily with Laplace method. Laplace method is the easy way to reach exact solution of some ODEs.

dy/dx=y-(1/2)*e^(x/2)*sin⁡(5x)+5e^(x/2)*cos⁡(5x)

Solution:
(ℒ) 
S*Y-Y(0)=Y-0.5*(5/((S-0.5)^2+25))+5*((S-0.5)/(((S-0.5)^2+25))

Y*(S-1)=Y(0)+5*((S-0.5)/((S-0.5)^2+25)-0.5/((S-0.5)^2+25))

Y*(S-1)=Y(0)+5*((S-1)/((S-0.5)^2+25))  
One of the answer which called public answer is S=1 but this is not answer which work for us. 
The second answer is:
Y=5/((S-0.5)^2+25)
Now we can get Laplace inverse to find a solution which we need.
(ℒ -1)
y(x)=e^0.5x*sin⁡5x


Another way to find a solution for this ODE is to do Change of variables.
If we define a µ(x)= e^(-x)   and take integral we will reach the same solution.

We were able to find a exact solution for this ODE, but sometimes it is very hard to find axact solution. Alternatively, math scientists inttroduces approxiame methods which try to find a solution with numerical ways but the problem is that the solution would not be exact. accurancy of these method was always part of scientific discussions. 

Here we run a solution with four different method to compare them and see the accurancy of them. For methods are exact solution, Euler method, Midpoint method and RK4.
